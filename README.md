Program that reads numbers from a file in ascending or descending order using file I/O

Write a program that reads numbers from a file, sorts the numbers in numerical order from highest to lowest values
(descending order) or vice versa (ascending order), and finally write the sorted numbers in another file. The input file
will contain the number of elements in the file, type of sorting required (a or d), and the numbers.
Follow these steps:
i)		Read the number of elements in the file
ii)		Read the type of sorting (ascending or descending)
iii)	Create a dynamic array to store the number (size must be equal to the number read from the file)
iv)		Sort the array
v)		In the output file, please first write the number of elements, and the numbers in the desired order.
